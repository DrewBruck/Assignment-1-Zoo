        A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears
        distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have
        long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food and
        textiles. Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert
        habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo.
