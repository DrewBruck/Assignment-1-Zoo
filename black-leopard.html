        A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of the leopard and the
        jaguar. Black panthers of both species have excess black pigments, but
        their typical rosettes are also present. They have been documented
        mostly in tropical forests, with black leopards in Africa and Asia, and
        black jaguars in South America. Melanism is caused by a recessive allele
        in the leopard, and by a dominant allele in the jaguar.
