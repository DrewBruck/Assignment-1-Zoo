        The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, is a
        small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It
        has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined
        ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. The red panda inhabits
        coniferous forests as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forests,
        favouring steep slopes with dense bamboo cover close to water sources.
        It is solitary and largely arboreal. It feeds mainly on bamboo shoots
        and leaves, but also on fruits and blossoms.
