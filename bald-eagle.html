        The bald eagle is a North American bird of prey. A centuries-long 
        cultural and religious icon for Native Americans and the national
        emblem of the United States, this mighty raptor has a wingspan of
        5.5-8 feet and a height of 28-38 inches. They are a carnivorous 
        species whose diet consists mainly of fish, but have been known to
        eat small mammals such as rabbits, squirrels and even young deer
        whenever fish populations fall scarce. Despite their name, bald 
        eagles are actually not bald. Their name derives from an old 
        translation of "piebald", meaning "white-headed".
