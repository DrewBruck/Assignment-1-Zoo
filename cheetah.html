        The fastest land animal and easily recognized by it's spotted fur, Cheetah's
        can run up to 80mph! Their bodies are unlike any other cat in the genus
        Panthera, as their bodies are thinner, taller, with claws that cannot retract.
        Due to their incredibly high running speeds, Cheetah's also have a thicker, 
        longer tail than any other cat as it provides ballast and helps counter their
        weight to make turns at high speeds. They are a carnivorous species whose prey
        ranges from small to medium ungulates, animals such as antelope, impalas, or
        giraffes. Despite their speeds and majesty, or perhaps because of it, Cheetah's
        are too often the victims of poachers. Between poachers and an ever-shrinking
        habitat from human encroachment, Cheetah's are listed as "vulnerable" by the 
        International Union for Conservation of Nature and are listed as "endangered"
        by the Endangered Species Act.
