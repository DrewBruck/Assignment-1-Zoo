        The largest living primates, Gorillas dwell in Sub-Saharan Africa 
        amongst a vast range of elevations. They are herbivorous and are 
        the closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos. 
        Depending on the factors being compared, they have a 95-99% DNA 
        similarity to humans. The genus “Gorilla” is divided into two species, 
        the eastern gorilla and western gorilla, both of which are listed as 
        critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation 
        of Nature. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.
