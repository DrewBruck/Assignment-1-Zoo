        Native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, 
        snowy owls are one of the largest species of owl and the only owl with 
        mainly white plumage. Unlike other owls that sleep during the day and 
        hunt at night, snowy owls are most active during the day, hunting mainly 
        small mammals and northerly water birds. An opportunistic hunter, they 
        will also take advantage of carrion if the need necessitates. Snowy owls 
        are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation 
        of Nature with fewer than 500,000 snowy owls left in the world. Though 
        this number may seem large, it is quite small for birds.
