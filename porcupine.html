        Porcupines are the prickliest rodents with coats of 30,000 quills to defend themselves from daring predators.
         As Herbivores, they get their nutrition from wood, bark, nuts, fruits and seeds. Although they dont typicaly eat meat like <a href="otter.html"> carnivores</a> ,they sometimes chew on bones and eat already dead animals for important minerals such as calcium and salt.
          They are found all over the world in North American, Africa, Europe, and Asia. Some species include African Bush-Tailed Porcupines, Asiatic Bush-Tailed Porcupines, Sumatran Porcupines, Mexican Dwarf Hairy Porcupine and North American Porcupines, as pictured above!
