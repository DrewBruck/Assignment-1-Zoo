        Porcupines are the prickliest rodents, with coats of 30,000 quills to defend themselves from daring predators. As herbivores, they obtain their nutrition from wood, bark, nuts, fruits, and seeds.
         Although they don't typically eat meat like <a href="otter.html"> carnivores</a>, they sometimes chew on bones and consume already dead animals 
         for important minerals such as calcium and salt. They are found all over the world in North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. 
         Some species include African Bush-Tailed Porcupines, Asiatic Bush-Tailed Porcupines, Sumatran Porcupines, Mexican Dwarf Hairy Porcupines,
          and North American Porcupines, as pictured above!
