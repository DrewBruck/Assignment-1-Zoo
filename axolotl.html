        The Axolotl, also known as Ambystoma mexicanum, is an amphibian found in Lake Xochimilco, Mexico. They get their name from an ancient Aztec mythology god, Xolotl, who had a <a href="dog.html"> dog</a> head. 
        According to the myth, this god of fire and lightning transformed into an axolotl to avoid being sacrificed. 
        In the wild, they are a dark brown color, but in captivity, they are lighter-colored with white bodies and pink gills.
        They are carnivores and eat small fish, worms, and insects. Newly hatched axolotls, hungry for their first meal, will sometimes snack on their siblings' limbs. 
        Don't worry; they can regenerate almost all parts of their bodies, including their brains.
         Due to urbanization and the destruction of their habitats, axolotls are currently critically endangered and at risk of extinction. 
        Only 50 to 1000 individuals are left in the wild.
