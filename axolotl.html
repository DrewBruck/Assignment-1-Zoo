        The Axolotl, also known as the Ambystoma mexicanum, is an Amphibian found in Lake Xochimilco Mexico. In the wild, they are a dark brown color but in captivity they are lighter colored with white bodies and pink gills!
        They are carnivores and eat small fish, worms and insects. Newly hatched axolotls, hungry for their first meal, will sometimes snack on their siblings limbs. Dont worry, they can regenerate almost all parts of their bodies, including their brains. 
        Due to urbanization and destruction of their habitats, axolotls are currently critically endangered and at risk for extiniction. Only 50 - 1000 are left in the wild.
        They get their name from an ancient Aztec mythology god Xolotl, who had a dog head. According to the myth, this god of fire and lightning transformed into an axolotl to avoid being sacrificed.
