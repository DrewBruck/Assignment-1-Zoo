        African wild dogs, also known as painted wolves, are highly social carnivores native to sub-Saharan Africa. They primarily feast on impalas, wildebeests, gazelles, and other hoofed animals, but eat hares and rodents such as <a href="porcupine.html">porcupines</a>  when larger prey is scarce. These long-legged canines have only four toes per foot, unlike other dogs, which have five toes on their forefeet. 
        They are social pack animals and commonly gather in packs of 10.
        Despite their adaptability and intelligence, they are one of the most endangered animals, with a population of only 1,409 left in the wild. 
        African wild dogs are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their livestock. They also face habitat loss. 
        Conservation efforts are critical in ensuring the survival of these species!
