        Otters are playful, carnivorous, semi-<a href="axolotl.html"> aquatic</a> animals found in every continent except Antartica and Australia. There are 13 species in total.
         Their webbed feet and powerful tails make them very strong swimmers, along with their special fur that keeps them sealed from water. Otters have the densest fur of any animalâ€”as many as a million hairs per square inch in places. River otters enjoy eating mostly aquatic organisms including fish, frogs, crayfish, turtles, insects and some small mammals. Although they mostly live in pairs, they are extremely social creatures and socialize in groups as well!
